+ look into alternative models of relation learning, check their theoretical difference and relate to human learning literature (older cognitive science theory about relation learning from instances?).

+ adapt models above to knowledge base (YAGO, DBpedia) to compare model performance on large scaled dataset. Performance comparison metrics include link-prediction and taxonomy-learning task.
> direct reference: Nickel, Tresp, and Kriegel, “Factorizing Yago.”

+ a new kind of task: see if the model can automatically learn "basic types of relation". Compare to classic cognitive theory (eg, Quillian theory proposed five different kinds of link).

+ find anomaly, i.e. entities that don’t agree with the learned high probability relations, and ask question (“why don’t ….?”).
